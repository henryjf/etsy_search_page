My uncle was an auctioneer and dealer since long before I was born and, having no children of his own, took me on to pass down his personal legacy. He has been teaching me about the subtleties and details in which one can tell the genuine article from the fake and reproduced since I was a small child. Since 1996 I have been working hand in hand with him in our antique businesses. \n\nMaking vintage inspired jewelry has also given me a leg up in the world of antique jewelry as lately I have seen the field flooded with antique reproductions made with the SAME EXACT components I make my handmade jewelry with. Its unfortunate, but true. The more frightening aspect of this is that when I occasionally and respectfully point out to these dealers that they are selling a reproduction piece they tend to get extremely hostile. Because of this, I have been holding my tongue more and more, but still feel awful about the bum deal someone is going to get. \n\nWhile I have extensive knowledge of antiques and collectibles, there is no way the human brain, even with the aid of every price guide in print, could know everything about everything. I describe my antiques to the best of my ability and reference multiple sources before making educated statements about a piece. I stand behind what I sell and if you find out that a piece is not as described I will happily offer you a refund.","creation_tsz":1460913172,"ending_tsz":1471453972,"original_creation_tsz":1359100032,"last_modified_tsz":1460913172,"price":"7.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["cuff links","anniversary","men jewelry","retro rockabilly","graduation","formal tuxedo","man father day","steampunk art deco","post modern","modernism mod","square rectangular","gold fill rolled","antique cufflinks"],"category_path":["Accessories","Cuff Links"],"category_path_ids":[69150467,69153851],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":5060401,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1460569825,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/121593256\/vintage-mod-rectangular-cufflinks-gold?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":99,"num_favorers":3,"shipping_template_id":15541177,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"someone_else","is_supply":"false","when_made":"1950s","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Art Deco","Retro"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":52,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Suit & Tie Accessories","Cuff Links & Tie Clips","Cuff Links"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":420027748,"hex_code":"D7C2A3","red":215,"green":194,"blue":163,"hue":36,"saturation":24,"brightness":84,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1359100032,"listing_id":121593256,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_75x75.420027748_grff.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_170x135.420027748_grff.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_570xN.420027748_grff.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_fullxfull.420027748_grff.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":420035289,"hex_code":"D7C09D","red":215,"green":192,"blue":157,"hue":36,"saturation":26,"brightness":84,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1359100032,"listing_id":121593256,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5121477\/il_75x75.420035289_sgoq.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5121477\/il_170x135.420035289_sgoq.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5121477\/il_570xN.420035289_sgoq.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5121477\/il_fullxfull.420035289_sgoq.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":420027758,"hex_code":"CEA87E","red":206,"green":168,"blue":126,"hue":32,"saturation":38,"brightness":80,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1359100032,"listing_id":121593256,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/5121477\/il_75x75.420027758_dj9b.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/5121477\/il_170x135.420027758_dj9b.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/5121477\/il_570xN.420027758_dj9b.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/5121477\/il_fullxfull.420027758_dj9b.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":420027780,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1359100032,"listing_id":121593256,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_75x75.420027780_oi8g.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_170x135.420027780_oi8g.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_570xN.420027780_oi8g.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5121477\/il_fullxfull.420027780_oi8g.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5121477,"shop_name":"NouveauMotley","user_id":18695,"creation_tsz":1138300417,"title":"Antique Curiosities, Upcycled Jewelry, Objets d&#39;Art","announcement":"\u2605Welcome to Nouveau Motley; a Neo-Victorian wonder emporium!\u2605\r\nHome to exceptional Steampunk and upcycled jewelry of the highest caliber for the discriminating Neo-Victorian enthusiast.

Steampunk Leather Leg Brace","description":"A couple of years ago I dislodged my kneecap and was unable to get surgery for a few years. I tried wearing a common leg brace but it just wasn&#39;t cool enough looking to wear for that length of time. I wanted to make a statement in leather, so this is what I came up with. I wore and worked in this rig everyday for 3 years and it has another 50 yrs. left in it. This is a super comfortable piece.\n \n The body of this awesome brace is 10\/12 oz tooling leather and is lined behind the knee with an interchangeable shearling back pad.  The brace is completely hand tooled, hand stitched and dyed saddle tan then antiqued to give it an aged luster. The overall length is 23.25&quot; with 11&quot; from top to center knee.\n \n In picture 3 The 4 vertical rows of stitching house aluminum stays for rigidity. A belt loop attachment helps keep the brace in place at the knee. The 6 straps are adjustable for a comfortable thigh and calf fit to immobilize the leg and keep it straight. \n\nI am offering this as a Steam-punk leg accessory for a character whom has been injured whilst traveling or took an arrow to the leg . \n \nI am not a certified leg brace maker by any means but this did the trick for me.\n\nShipping, I had to put some shipping on it but send me your info for accurate shipping charges.","creation_tsz":1460913068,"ending_tsz":1471453868,"original_creation_tsz":1391145004,"last_modified_tsz":1460913068,"price":"575.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["Steampunk","Leg

This is not a reproduction, but genuine &quot;farm fresh&quot;.  The modern electrical wiring has been cleverly wrapped, hidden, or embedded into the fixture.  The trolley is mounted to a reclaimed wood beam, just as it would have been in a barn when it was a working trolley.  A re-purposed old iron handle serves to link the barn beam to the pulley\n\nThe lamp also features 4 Mason canning jar shades.   If you don&#39;t like the canning jar shades, they can be easily replaced with any 2 1\/4 inch shade.  Insure that if you purchase this lamp, you mount it securely, as the lamp is cast iron and is quite heavy. A sturdy hanging hook and round light cover will be included at no additional charge upon request.  This lamp is setup for 3-wire direct wiring.

It looked spectacular so I thought I would post it.\n\nIt fits nicely in the corner of the room as the bulbs are placed at a 90 degree angle from one another. \n\nWhat really makes the lamp interesting is the copper shades. The filament bulbs reflect off of them and give a great amber glow. \n\nThis fixture uses high end unpolished nickel sockets that can be switched on and off independently. It will come with two 60 watt globe shaped edison bulbs.\n\nThis lamp is constructed from heavy industrial style black iron piping. The vintage bulb is easy for anyone to change and can now be found a the big box hardware stores. Power is supplied by a vintage style cloth covered cord. A large iron flange and reclaimed wood make up the base. \n\nDimensions:\n\nH: 70&quot;\nW: 20&quot;\nD: 10&quot;\n\n \nAs each lamp is handcrafted and unique they are subject to minute variations from the picture above. \n\nWe package our vintage merchandise with care.\n\nInternational? Simply use a step down converter to enjoy our lamps on 220V.

There is NO lock included.  I often have customers who request additional strap colors and use the same lock so to make it easier for everyone I&#39;ve created this listing.\n\nThis collar is crafted from a hand cut strip of leather (roughly 3\/8&quot; wide), measured twice for length and a loop fashioned at one end.  The other end is matched up so the final product looks even, and a loop placed in that end.\n\nThe loops on each end are held together with a small lock.  The larger of the two heart locks that I sell is the one shown in the pictures.  The lock is available in a silver or gold tone and comes with a key to unlock it.  This particular listing is for a collar with NICKEL hardware (lock and rivets). \n\n*** All packages are mailed in very PLAIN packaging (Manila padded envelopes or US Postal Priority boxes) with my personal name and address.
