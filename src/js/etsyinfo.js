All you have to do is turn it, assemble your chosen kit, and you will have a very marketable, beautifully hand crafted pen. It is sold for the PSI Bolt Action, Magnum Bolt Action style and the Sierra\/Sienna style pen kits. \n\nCast in premium grade Alumilite with the Punisher image applied to an aluminum embossed background with boiler plate style caps. This blank is sure to be a hit with your customers once paired with the PSI Bolt Action pen kit. It looks fabulous and will turn heads!\n\nI can also do this in a Sierra\/Sienna\/Wall Street style pen kit. The price is the same and the design is the same, just a bit larger.\n\nThank you for stopping by my Etsy shop and looking around. I really appreciate your time and each item purchased. I hope that your purchase will become a family heirloom and treasured for generations to come.\n\nCopyright 2015 Hobble Creek Craftsman Studios. All rights reserved.

A little flirty, a bit dramatic, and always unique--you can wear this bustle with skirts, dresses, shorts, pants or leggings.  It&#39;ll be a great addition to your wardrobe!  \n\nBustle is hand made from a lovely lilac purple lace.  Waistband has a lilac cotton backing for stability and comfort, while draped side panels remain unlined, giving them a lovely semi-sheer quality.   Antiqued brass grommets in front allowing for the perfect fit!  Purple ribbon included for lacing.\n\nThis bustle is MADE TO ORDER, to your measurements!\n\n**At time of purchase please include the following measurements (in inches) in the &quot;note to seller&quot; portion of the transaction or in a separate message:\n\n--waist (narrowest part) (if your waist is 38 inches or larger, please contact me prior to purchase)\n--hip\n\n**Please keep in mind that these are made 1-1.5 inches SMALLER than the waist measurement provided to accommodate the right fit.  Should you want your bustle to be an EXACT measurement, please specify (but know that there are NO RETURNS on made to order work, so please take special care in measuring) in the &quot;note to seller&quot; portion of the invoice, where you give your measurements.  If you&#39;ll be wearing this over a corset, please take measurements while corset is on.\n\nA handy measurement cheat sheet can be found here: http:\/\/trappedintimedesigns.com\/2013\/05\/09\/measuring\/\n\n**Plus Sizes are available (for a slight additional cost)--please contact me for price quote if your waist is 38 inches or above.\n\n**I cannot stress enough how important it is to send accurate measurements. This means taking a dressmakers tape measure and physically measuring the correct areas. I can only make an item to the measurements I am given, and there are NO REFUNDS on custom made items. If you want &quot;wiggle room&quot; or something tighter than your measurements, please factor that in. If you would like help or a guide to measuring, please let me know--I&#39;m happy to help out! Note that bra size, pants size, dress size, etc, is not accurate enough--I work from different types of measurements, and if given those, your item will not come out to your size. I am happy to make alterations to your custom garment, but you will be responsible for shipping charges on your end as well as mine, so please--DOUBLE CHECK your measurements! :)**\n\nCOMMENTS FROM
